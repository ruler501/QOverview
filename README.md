## How to Install

### Prerequisites

The following programs must be installed before installing QOverview. Package names of these for major distros are listed alongside.

- Python 3
- PyQt 5 (Arch: `python-pyqt5`, `qt5-declarative` | Ubuntu: `python3-pyqt5`, `python3-pyqt5.qtquick` | SUSE: `python3-qt5` | Fedora: `python3-PyQt5`)
- Python-DBus (Arch: `python-dbus` | Ubuntu: `python3-dbus` | SUSE: `python-dbus` | Fedora: `python3-dbus`)
- Python-GObject (Arch: `python-gobject` | Ubuntu: `python3-gi` | SUSE: `python3-gobject` | Fedora: `pygobject3`)

<small>If the listed package names are incorrect/don't work/etc please report the issue!</small>

### Installation

Download and run this:

    $ sudo ./install.sh

**NOTE**: Don't want to use the KDE Frameworks version? Add `--no-kde-frameworks` to the command above.

**NOTE**: To uninstall, use the above command with `--uninstall`

## How to Setup & Use

### Initial Setup

1. Set the `qoverview-config-server` command to run on startup.

2. Run the command `qoverview-config-server >/dev/null 2>&1 & disown` in a terminal.

3. Add items to the dock using the file `~/.config/qoverview.yaml`. See [Settings](#settings).

4. You can now put the `qoverview` command on a shortcut key, and/or a screen corner.

See your desktop's settings tool for these.

For putting QOverview on a screen corner, see [Binding to screen corner](#binding-to-screen-corner).

### Use

Press said shortcut key/screen corner and see!


**NOTE**: In QOverview, middle mouse button click on a window will *close* it. This can be disabled, see [settings](#settings)

**NOTE**: To drag-and-drop a window to a workspace, drag it by holding the title bar below the window.

## Settings

See the file `~/.config/qoverview.yaml`. It has all the settings (and is quite well-commented).

## Binding to screen corner

The `xdotool` utility will allow you to do bind QOverview to a screen corner or edge easily.

You can bind to the following corners and edges of the screen:

- `top`
- `bottom`
- `left`
- `right`

- `top-left`
- `top-right`
- `bottom-left`
- `top-right`

To do this, run the command

    $ xdotool behave_screen_edge EDGE_OR_CORNER exec qoverview

where `EDGE_OR_CORNER` is to be replaced with the position of your choice from the list above.

Also, set the above-mentioned command to run at startup.

## What works and what doesn't

Every feature of GNOME Activities is provided, exceptâ€¦

- A more natural layout for the windows
